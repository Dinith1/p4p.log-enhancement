# `/embeddings/py_obj`

- This folder is intended to hold a 'pickled'/saved Python object representing a dictionary mapping each word in the
embedding matrix to its corresponding vector (essentially to cache the pre-trained GloVe vector)

- Everything saved to this folder will be ignored in order to save on space in the Git repo.
